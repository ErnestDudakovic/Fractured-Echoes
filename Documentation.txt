Fractured Echoes (Unity) — Full Game Design & Technical Roadmap

Psychological Horror Puzzle → First Person Experience → Dynamic Environment → Atmosphere-Driven Systems → Thesis Implementation

1) Vision

Develop a first-person psychological horror puzzle game in Unity where:

Space gradually changes

Puzzles drive narrative progression

Atmosphere is built through lighting, audio, and scripted events

Player experiences tension through uncertainty, transformation, and perception shifts

Core pillars:

Psychological tension over jumpscares

Environmental storytelling

Controlled pacing

Reactive world design

Gradual mechanical evolution per location

2) Core Game Identity

Genre:
Psychological Horror + Puzzle + Exploration

Scene morph logic

This is the psychological core.

Stage 4 — Puzzle Design & Integration

Multi-step puzzles

Inventory-based puzzles

Environmental manipulation puzzles

Light/shadow-based puzzles

Audio-based puzzles

Perception puzzles

Each location introduces one new mechanic.

Stage 5 — Polish & Thesis Documentation

Technical architecture

Design decisions

Development phases

Challenges and solutions

4) Core Architecture

Engine:
Unity 3D

Language:
C#

Architecture Principles:

Modular systems

Event-driven communication

State-based progression

Decoupled puzzle logic

ScriptableObjects for data

5) Game Structure
Game
 ├── Location_1
 ├── Location_2
 ├── Location_3
 ├── Location_4
 ├── Location_5


Each Location:

Introduces new mechanic

Has unique visual identity

Contains 1–3 puzzles

Contains 1 scripted environmental shift

Advances narrative

6) Core Systems Specification
6.1 First Person Controller

Features:

Smooth movement

Camera sway

Subtle breathing effect

Head bob

Footstep audio variation

Dynamic FOV shifts during stress

Optional psychological enhancements:

Slight camera drift

Occasional micro input delay

Subtle aim instability

6.2 Interaction System

Raycast-based.

All interactables implement:

IInteractable


Interaction types:

Pickup

Inspect

Activate

Use on object

Trigger event

Must support:

Context-sensitive prompts

Interaction lock during events

Narrative triggers

6.3 Inventory System

Simple but immersive:

Grid-based or minimal list

Inspect mode (rotate object in 3D)

Combine items

Use item on environment

Trigger puzzle states

6.4 Puzzle Framework

Every puzzle:

Has state machine

Emits completion event

Can trigger environment changes

Can lock progression

Puzzle structure:

Puzzle
 ├── Conditions
 ├── Progress State
 ├── Completion Event
 ├── Failure Feedback

6.5 Scripted Event System

Core psychological system.

Types:

Object appearance/disappearance

Sound trigger

Lighting flicker

Shadow movement

Environmental rearrangement

Hallway extension illusion

Door relocation

Subtle geometry change

Trigger methods:

Enter area

Solve puzzle

Pick up object

Look at object

Timer-based

Combination triggers

Must support:

One-time triggers

Conditional triggers

Delayed triggers

6.6 Environment State Manager

Central controller that:

Tracks progression state

Applies environmental variations

Controls which version of room is active

Handles transformation phases

Example:

State 0 → Clean Room
State 1 → Slightly altered
State 2 → Distorted
State 3 → Fully corrupted

6.7 Lighting System

Atmosphere priority.

Use:

Baked + real-time mixed lighting

Light flicker script

Color temperature shifts

Shadow exaggeration

Dynamic intensity transitions

Light as puzzle mechanic

Psychological lighting tools:

Slow intensity pulses

Gradual color shift to colder tones

Selective darkness

Partial light failures

6.8 Audio System

Layered ambient audio:

Base ambient loop

Subtle random distant sounds

Directional audio triggers

Positional whispers

Puzzle feedback audio

Environmental tension ramp

Advanced:

Dynamic low-pass filter when stressed

Volume shifts based on proximity

Silence as tension mechanic

7) Psychological Design Tools

To create unease:

Repetition with variation

Slight spatial inconsistencies

Object repositioning

Subtle geometry distortion

Unreliable environmental memory

Sound before visual confirmation

Slow changes rather than instant ones

Avoid overusing:

Loud jumpscares

Constant noise

Overexposure to horror elements

8) Example Location Progression
Location 1 — Apartment

Mechanic: Basic interaction + simple inventory puzzle
Transformation: Minor object movement

Location 2 — Corridor Loop

Mechanic: Space illusion
Transformation: Corridor extends

Location 3 — Library

Mechanic: Light-based puzzle
Transformation: Books rearrange silently

Location 4 — Basement

Mechanic: Sound-based puzzle
Transformation: Walls distort

Location 5 — Final Location

Mechanic: Combined mechanics
Transformation: Reality fragmentation
